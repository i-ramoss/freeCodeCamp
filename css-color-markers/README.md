## :pushpin: About:

In this project I developed and styled a color marker. Here I learned about how to add colors to a page, in different ways (hexadecimal, rgb, rgba, hsl), as well as how to combine them so they don't look out of place. I also made use of gradients to give a very interesting effect to the element.
